##  Overview

This project examines whether digital learning tools significantly improve mathematics test scores compared to traditional classroom instruction. The analysis employs independent samples t-test to compare achievement between two groups of Grade 9 students.

**Key Findings:** Digital learning students scored **6.80 points higher** on average (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 1.15), representing a large and statistically significant effect.

##  Research Question

**Does digital learning result in significantly higher mathematics scores compared to traditional classroom methods for Grade 9 students?**

##  Dataset

- **Total Students:** 60
- **Digital Learning Group:** 30 students
- **Conventional Learning Group:** 30 students
- **Variables:** Student ID, Group, Math Score, Gender, Attendance (%)
- **File:** `Marks.csv`

##  Methodology

### Statistical Test
**Independent Samples t-Test** (One-tailed)

### Hypotheses
- **H₀:** μ_digital = μ_conventional (no difference)
- **H₁:** μ_digital > μ_conventional (digital is better)
- **Significance Level:** α = 0.05

### Assumptions Checked
1. Independence of observations
2.  Normality (Shapiro-Wilk test)
3. Homogeneity of variance (Levene's test)

## Results

| Metric | Digital Group | Conventional Group |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Mean** | 80.90 | 74.10 |
| **SD** | 5.32 | 6.47 |
| **Range** | [71, 91] | [61, 88] |

**Test Statistics:**
- t-statistic: 4.4479
- p-value: < 0.0001 ⭐
- Cohen's d: 1.1484 (Large effect)
- 95% CI: [3.80, 9.80]

**Conclusion:** Reject H₀ - Digital learning significantly improves math scores
